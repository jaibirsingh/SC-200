# What is Advanced hunting 
* Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data.
* The advanced hunting capability supports queries that check a broader data set from:
    * Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
    * Microsoft Defender for Office 365
    * Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
    * Microsoft Defender for Identity
* To use advanced hunting, turn on Microsoft Defender XDR.
* Advanced hunting data can be categorized into two distinct types, each consolidated differently.
    * **Event or activity data** — populates tables about alerts, security events, system events, and routine assessments.
    * **Entity data** — populates tables with information about users and devices. This data comes from both relatively static data sources and dynamic sources, such as Active Directory entries and event logs.

## Detection rules
* For example, we have written a query to find recent occurences of files sent by a malicious sender in our organization.
* We canuse this query to create a detection rule. --> Click "Create detection rule"

## Time zone
* Time information in advanced hunting is in the UTC zone.

## Data schema
* The advanced hunting schema is made up of multiple tables that provide either event information or information about devices, alerts, identities, and other entity types.
* To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to understand the tables and the columns in the advanced hunting schema.

## Investigate Microsoft Entra sign-in logs
* To perform a sign-in investigation including conditional access policies evaluated, you can query the following tables with KQL:

1. Location	= Microsoft Defender XDR Threat Hunting .... Table = AADSignInEventsBeta
2. Location = Microsoft Entra ID Log Analytics ....	Table = SigninLogs

* The Microsoft Entra monitoring Sign-in Logs provide access to the same information available in the SigninLogs table.
* To access the Sign-in Logs blade, select Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal, then Sign-in Logs in the Monitoring Group.
* The query output will provide default columns including the Date, User, Application, Status, and Conditional Access (policy applied).
