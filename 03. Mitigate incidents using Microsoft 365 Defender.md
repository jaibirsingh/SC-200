# Manage incidents
## What is an incident
* An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack.

## What is Microsoft Defender XDR
* Microsoft Defender XDR automatically aggregates malicious and suspicious events that are found in different device, user, and mailbox entities in the network.
***
# Automated investigations
* Once an alert is raised by Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, automated investigation run several playbooks to ensure no threat was left unhandled.
* If similar incidents were discovered in the hstorical data, those are also added to the incident for better understanding of the alert.
*  For example, suppose a malicious file resides on a device. When that file is detected, an alert is triggered, and the automated investigation process begins.
*  Microsoft Defender for Endpoint checks to see if the malicious file is present on any other devices in the organization.
*  Details from the investigation, including verdicts (Malicious, Suspicious, and No threats found) are available during and after the automated investigation.
*  To learn more about what happens after a verdict is reached, see Automated investigation results and remediation actions.
* **Automation levels**
1. not protected - No automation at all
2. Semi - require approval for any remediation
3. Semi - require approval for non-temp folders
4. Semi - require approval for core folders (the folder that's in a system directory like Windows or Program folders)
5. Full - remdiate threats automatically for all the folders.

* Automation details can be seen in Defender for Endpoints.

* When an automated investigation runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts can be Malicious, Suspicious, or No threats found

# Remediation
* **Source**
  * Automated investigation
  * Microsoft Defender Antivirus
  * Manual response actions

* **Supported Actions**
  * Isolate device
  * Restrict code execution
  * Quarantine a file
  * Remove a registry key
  * Stop a service
  * Disable a driver
  * Remove a scheduled task
 
# Action center
* The unified Action center of the Microsoft Defender portal lists pending and completed remediation actions for your devices, email & collaboration content, and identities in one location.

# Submissions
* In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes, admins can use the Submissions portal in the Microsoft Defender portal to submit email messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft for scanning.
* **To submit messages and files to Microsoft, you need to have one of following roles**: Security Administrator or Security Reader in the Microsoft Defender portal.
* Admins can submit messages as old as 30 days if it's still available in the mailbox and not purged by the user or another admin.
* Admin submissions are throttled at the following rates:
    * Maximum submissions in any 15-minutes period: 150 submissions
    * Same submissions in a 24 hour period: Three submissions
    * Same submissions in a 15-minute period: One submission
 
*  **Note**:
  *  File and URL submissions are not available in the clouds that do not allow for data to leave the environment. The ability to select File or URL will be greyed out.

* Upload the email file (.msg or .eml): Select Browse files. In the dialog that opens, find and select the .eml or .msg file, and then select Open.
* In the Choose a recipient who had an issue box, specify the recipient that you would like to run a policy check against. The policy check will determine if the email bypassed scanning due to user or organization policies.
* In the Select a reason for submitting to Microsoft section, select one of the following options:
    * Shouldn't have been blocked (False positive)
    * Should have been blocked (False negative): In the, "The email should have been categorized as" section that appears, select one of the following values (if you're not sure, use your best judgment): Phish, Malware, or Spam

* When you're finished, select Submit.

## Converting user reported messages from the custom mailbox into an admin submission
* If you've configured the custom mailbox to intercept user-reported messages without sending the messages to Microsoft, you can find and send specific messages to Microsoft for analysis.
* On the User reported messages tab, select a message in the list, select Submit to Microsoft for analysis, and then select one of the following values from the dropdown list:
    * Report clean
    * Report phishing
    * Report malware
    * Report spam
    * Trigger investigation
